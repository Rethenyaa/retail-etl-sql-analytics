# 🛒 Retail Sales ETL & Analytics Pipeline

An end-to-end data engineering and analytics project using the **UCI Online Retail Dataset**.  
This project demonstrates how to build a simple but powerful ETL pipeline using **Python, Pandas, SQLite, SQL**, and **Google Colab**, followed by **visualizations** and an **auto-generated business report**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- ✅ **Extract** data from Excel (`.xlsx`) file hosted on Google Drive  
- ✅ **Transform** data using Pandas: clean, preprocess, and create new fields  
- ✅ **Load** the clean data into an in-memory SQLite database  
- ✅ Perform SQL queries to derive **business insights**  
- ✅ Generate **visual dashboards** using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`  
- ✅ Auto-generate a plain-text **summary report**
